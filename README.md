# Fruit-Recognition
CNN Model to predict the type of fruit

# Abstract
Fruit classification process is commercially important. Fruit production at harvest time is quite high. Classification of fruits according to their types and characteristics is usually done by hand and eye. This method can cause huge losses in terms of time, cost and labor. If we implement a ML model to classify fruits, we will save time and resources. We have built a fruit recognition model using tensorflow’s sequential graph. We do image processing to improve the dataset so as to obtain optimum results. Compared to other machine learning (ML) algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), deep neural networks (DNN) provide promising results to identify fruits in images.


# Dataset
The dataset contains images of the following categories:

banana, apple, pear, grapes, orange, kiwi, watermelon, pomegranate, pineapple, mango, cucumber, carrot, capsicum, onion, potato, lemon, tomato, raddish, beetroot, cabbage, lettuce, spinach, soybean, cauliflower, bell pepper, chili pepper, turnip, corn, sweetcorn, sweet potato, paprika, jalepeño, ginger, garlic, peas, eggplant.

The dataset contains three folders:

	train (100 images each)
	test (10 images each)
	validation (10 images each)

Each of the above folders contains subfolders for different fruits wherein the images for respective food items are present.
